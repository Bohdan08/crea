                                   RESOLUTION
    
    
     
            Observing the 10th anniversary of the uprising in Syria.
    
    Whereas 10 years ago, on March 15, 2011, in the midst of the Arab Spring, 
            hundreds of Syrians peacefully assembled to call on their leadership for 
            democratic reforms and respect for their fundamental freedoms, sparking 
            a nationwide movement;
    Whereas in response to the predominantly peaceful protests, Syrian President 
            Bashar al-Assad ordered unyielding violence against the people of Syria, 
            including arbitrary detentions, torture, killing, and attacks on 
            civilians and civilian infrastructure, often under the false premise of 
            combating terrorism;
    Whereas over the course of this conflict, the Assad regime has exhibited 
            unrelenting depravity in its use of chemical weapons and barrel bombs, 
            deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and 
            schools, and committing gross violations of international humanitarian 
            law;
    Whereas the former Syrian military photographer Caesar'' meticulously 
            photographed the Assad regime's widespread system of arrest, detention, 
            torture and murder of tens of thousands of Syrian protesters and 
            dissidents, and then courageously smuggled 55,000 of those photographs 
            out of Syria, exposing the regime's barbarity for the world to witness;
    Whereas the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 8791 note), 
            which became law on December 20, 2019--
    
        (1) seeks accountability for the Assad regime and its international 
    enablers for atrocities against the Syrian people;
    
        (2) denies the Assad regime the resources to fuel its war machine; and
    
        (3) sends a clear signal to the international community against 
    normalizing, rehabilitating, or legitimizing Assad and his backers;
    
    Whereas Iran and Russia intervened militarily in support of the Assad regime, 
            enabling and actively participating in the Assad regime's horrific 
            brutalities against civilians in favor of advancing their narrow 
            interests and in some cases empowered extremist groups;
    Whereas in pursuit of its narrow self-interest, Russia, backed by China, has 
            blunted United Nations' efforts to preserve vital border crossings that 
            serve as a critical humanitarian lifeline to the beleaguered Syrian 
            population;
    Whereas the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria exacerbated the suffering of the 
            Syrian people through the violent and hostile seizure of territory, 
            misapplication of Islamic law, destruction and smuggling of antiquities, 
            and oil smuggling, turning Syria into a global hub for terrorist 
            activity;
    Whereas the Assad regime, and its Russian and Iranian backers, are largely 
            responsible for the death of more than 500,000 Syrian civilians, and the 
            displacement of more than 12,000,000 men, women, and children within and 
            outside of Syria's borders, imposing irreversible trauma and loss for a 
            whole generation;
    Whereas millions of Syrians are struggling to survive, with more than 13,000,000 
            Syrians who are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 
            9,000,000 Syrians who are facing food insecurity;
    Whereas international efforts to secure a peaceful political transition of power 
            in Syria, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 
            2254, adopted on December 18, 2015, remain stymied, due almost entirely 
            to the intransigence of Russia and the Assad regime, holding the people 
            of Syria hostage;
    Whereas the people and Government of the United States support the people of 
            Syria in their aspirations for peace, stability, dignity, and 
            accountability: Now, therefore, be it
        Resolved, That the Senate--
                (1) solemnly observes the 10th anniversary of the Syrian 
            uprising;
                (2) affirms that it is the policy of the United States--
                        (A) to seek a political solution to the Syrian 
                    conflict;
                        (B) to continue to stand with the people of Syria;
                        (C) to further efforts to secure a permanent 
                    ceasefire;
                        (D) to continue work on the constitutional 
                    committee free from regime intransigence; and
                        (E) to foster conditions for free and fair 
                    elections in accordance with United Nations Security 
                    Council Resolution 2254;
                (3) affirms that it is the policy of the United States to 
            promote adherence to the laws of war by all parties engaging in 
            hostilities in Syria;
                (4) affirms that it is the policy of the United States to 
            support international humanitarian efforts to assist innocent 
            civilians, including through support for displaced populations 
            and the promotion of accountability for perpetrators of human 
            rights abuses;
                (5) commits to continuing efforts to hold the Assad regime 
            and its Russian and Iranian backers accountable for war crimes 
            and crimes against humanity; including through implementation 
            of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019;
                (6) commends the bravery of Syrian human rights defenders 
            who, in the service of justice and accountability, have 
            courageously documented the atrocities committed by the Assad 
            regime and its Russian and Iranian backers over the course of 
            this conflict;
                (7) condemns the indiscriminate use of force by all actors 
            in Syria, including the Assad regime, its proponents, its 
            opponents, and extremist groups; and
                (8) calls on the United States Government to reinvigorate 
            diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict as outlined under 
            United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, and to expand 
            humanitarian aid to the Syrian people so they may--
                        (A) be free from violence, whether from the state 
                    or other armed groups;
                        (B) return to their communities of their own free 
                    will and in an informed manner;
                        (C) participate in transitional justice; and
                        (D) decide their own futures through free and fair 
                    elections that result in a legitimate representative 
                    government that serves all Syrians.

                                   RESOLUTION
    
    
     
    Designating March 8 through March 14, 2021, as Women of the Aviation 
                               Workforce Week''.
    
    Whereas the first week of March is internationally known as Women of Aviation 
            Worldwide Week'';
    Whereas Women of Aviation Worldwide Week was created by the Institute for Women 
            Of Aviation Worldwide;
    Whereas the aviation industry is anticipating a significant shortage of skilled 
            professionals in the coming years;
    Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor projected 
            that, in the next 10 years, the overall employment of airline and 
            commercial pilots is expected to grow more than 6 percent in the United 
            States;
    Whereas less than 2 percent of the aircraft maintenance technicians in the world 
            and less than 10 percent of all working aeronautical engineers are 
            women;
    Whereas the Federal Aviation Administration reports that less than 8 percent of 
            pilots and only 26 percent of air traffic controllers in the United 
            States are women;
    Whereas women make up only 24 percent of the employees in the aerospace 
            industry;
    Whereas aviation is a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
            (commonly known as STEM'') focused career path;
    Whereas the future of an abundant aviation workforce depends on a robust and 
            diverse pool of candidates; and
    Whereas women such as Amelia Earhart, Cicely Williams, Nicole Malachowski, 
            Bessie Coleman, and Jeannie Leavitt have inspired, and will continue to

        Resolved, That the Senate--

            diverse workforce, including women, veterans, and other 
            underrepresented individuals; and
                (5) commits to--

       winning the 2021 National Collegiate Athletic Association College

    Whereas the 2021 National Collegiate Athletic Association College Football
